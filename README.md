Introduction
------------

I'm Data Engineer using AI/ML aiming to automate all-exist repetitive tasks in order to save humanities from boredom.

Applying technologies to solve unnatural data-related problems with limited time and resources is my expertise.

Python programming, Google Cloud Platform, Architecture design and Software/Service evaluation are my outstanding skills.

Career Objective
----------------

I'm going to improve my English skills by studying an evening-session General English at Adelaide for six months. So, I hope I could find a company provided a part-time jobs to learn more about how amazing Australian working culture is.

If you think my skills are usable for your team in some way, don't hesitate to contact me for further cooperation.

Looking forward to here from you. I am very exciting for the incoming adventure.

Currently, I am holding Student visa (subclass 500) valid until 16 January 2023.
